           </div>   
          <p>DONALD A. MILLER, beloved husband, father, grandfather, great grandfather, friend, and retired Boeing engineer died in Milwaukie, Oregon on August 3, 2024. He was 91.</p>
          <p>Don was born on September 20, 1932 in Park Place, Oregon City in a small house affectionately referred to as “the chicken house” to Reva Smith. Don was raised by his grandmother Effie Smith and had a rural boyhood with uncles Delbert and Elbert and a colorful cast of uncles, aunts, and cousins. He often told of sleeping on a porch, selling fireworks with cousin Donna Jean, and watching his uncles lift up calves to determine if they were ready for the butcher. Initially given the last name Nutt after his absent father, his name was changed to Miller (from stepfather William Miller) as a teenager. However, he used the name Don Smith until he went to the army and wanted to cash checks written in his legal name.</p>
          <p>Don attended Oregon City High School and pursued his college degree before being drafted into the army during the end of the Korean War. He spent two years in Germany with the primary responsibility of chauffeur to the upper ranks. He returned home, finished his degree in engineering at Lewis & Clark, and secured a job at Boeing. He spoke of his early adulthood with happy nostalgia– he hitchhiked to Las Vegas to play craps in an effort to “get the hell out of Oregon City,” spent a summer laying the wooden floor of a school with stepfather Bill Miller, and was fired from a bakery for burning several trays of cookies. The bakers referred him to a job at Safeway which he worked for several years (and helped him pay for college). Effie’s diary reveals her happiness whenever he came around and it’s clear he was regarded as the “favorite.”</p>
          <p>In 1956, Don had Carolyn, the first of his six daughters. She was followed shortly thereafter by Julie, Theresa, Susie, Jackie and Nancy. In 1967,  he moved the family to Houston, TX to work on the Apollo project where he met his beloved Terrill Ann Grunski of New Orleans, LA. The two were married on the 4th of July in 1968.</p>
          <p>The family lived in San Bernardino, CA in a big house with several dogs before moving to Issaquah, Washington. Don and his daughters were featured in the newspaper for completing the Sound of Narrows race together as Don loved to run and encouraged his children to do the same. In 1986, Don and Terrill decided to buy and move into a 48 foot long sailboat called Garden Party where they lived for 12 years on Lake Washington with grandson Christopher Maes. Mishaps and mischief happened on board– there was a pet frog lost while under sail, a trip from Seattle to Portland, a grandson's broken arm thanks to Don's poor supervision, and Terrill’s delicious meals resourcefully prepared in the microwave.</p>
          <p>Don retired in 1995 and moved back to Oregon City where he would spend the rest of his days. He spent his time well in the company of family and a poorly behaved Bouvier De Flanders named Pierre. He worked on the house and yard, wrote his memoirs, obsessively tracked the Boeing stock price, woodworked, took trips to the coast, enjoyed relaxing mornings at Starbucks with Terrill, and often spoke with friends and family.</p>
          <p>A man with many strengths— he was warm, friendly, inquisitive, open, and laughed often. He loved math and geometry and would do the problem of the day well into his 80s. He believed in education and encouraged his children and grandchildren to pursue degrees. He was also stubborn, occasionally unreasonable, and refused the advice of professionals, especially doctors whom he hated to visit. He was curious and proud of his loved ones, asking many questions about how they were faring and what they were up to. He told wonderful stories of his early life in Oregon City, his career at Boeing, and the details of his pioneer history. He loved his wife dearly and the family he leaves behind will remember his call of “Terrill Ann!” long after his passing.</p>
          <p>Don leaves behind his wife Terrill Ann Miller, daughters Carolyn Miller, Theresa Miller, Susie Jones, Jackie Provance, Julie Miller, and Nancy Swenson, grandchildren Michael and Carrie, Julie and Emily, Christopher and Ashley, Kyle, Chase and Heidi and great grandchildren Stetson, Aella, Hunter, Elle, Daniel, Ryle, Julian, Fawn, Loah,  Winona and Stella  who brought him delight in the years before his passing. </p>
